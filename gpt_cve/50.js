// Example of Prototype chain vulnerability (CVE-ZZZZ)
// This is a hypothetical vulnerability for research purposes only.

// Define a base object with sensitive functionality
function BaseObject() {
  this.sensitiveData = "This is sensitive data.";
}

// Malicious object attempting to exploit the Prototype chain vulnerability
var maliciousObject = {
  // Prototype pollution attack: Modifying the prototype of BaseObject to inject a property
  __proto__: {
    // Attacker's malicious code to override sensitive data
    sensitiveData: "This is the modified sensitive data."
  }
};

// Victim object - innocently using the BaseObject functionality
var victimObject = new BaseObject();

// Merge victimObject's prototype with maliciousObject's prototype
Object.setPrototypeOf(victimObject, maliciousObject);

// Now, if victimObject is used unknowingly, it could trigger the Prototype chain vulnerability
// For example:
//console.log(victimObject.sensitiveData); // This will log the modified sensitive data
